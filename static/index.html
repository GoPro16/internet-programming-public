			<br> This goal of this assignment was to create an AboutMe page containing multiple sets of information pertaining to
			our life. From this assignment I have learned how to create a simple webpage containing different sorts of data and styling
			them to look visually appealing. Another lesson learned was the use of tables and organzing information for ease of readability.

			<br />In this assignment we must create a form that a user will fill out with free form information. The next step is
			to process the information and return if any of the inputs are invalid. If they are all valid then present the information
			in some sort of display format. For my assignment I decided to create a fake hackathon event and then prompt the user
			to fill out data pertaining to his or her preferences for the event. Finally if all the data is valid the user is presented
			with a nice output window of the receipt in a display bar to the right. In this assignment I learned about form control
			and the basics of implementing javascript functions to take data and write new elements onto the DOM.

			<br />The goal of this assignment is to introduce php, a serverside language embedded into html on the frontend. The purpose of this assignment is to create a stock portfolio manager that one uses to update his/her stocks and see the price of each. The MySQL database will be used next assignment however this one will use a file as a DB. From this assignment I have learned the basics of PHP and implementing authenication for certain pages to be viewed by a user.

		<p style="padding-left:10px"><span id="assignment-header" class="assign-title btn"><a class="link" href="assign6/index.php">Assignment 6</a> </span>
			<br />For this assignment, we needed to create a data driven application using MySQL and PHP. My implementation uses a Movie Table which contains information pertaining to 	different movies that are manually inputted. The goal of this assignment is to implement MySQL into a web app to give it a data driven experience. We also need to deal with the possiblilty of SQL injection and handle how we 
			will not allow it to happen in our applications. From this assignment I now have the knowedge of SQL commands and query strings as well as how to implement the SQL data into a PHP application.

			<br />This last assignment deals with AJAX calls for dynamic and seamless reloading of components on user events. The goal for this assignemnt is to use AJAX to filter the table we created in Assignment 6 using a combination of Javascript and PHP methods. In my implementation, I use a navigation bar to select multiple pre-made filters to filter the data in the table. From this assignemnt I have learned how useful AJAX can be, and how it can make the web view look a whole lot nicer.
